# Picture and Video Management

I chose organization of home photos and videos as a motivating project to learn Django. The website is intended to serve a few purposes:
* Keep a record of which pictures I have reviewed and decided to keep
* Make those photos and videos available online so reviewing files can be performed from anywhere with a phone
* Provide a link for extended family to see files on demand
